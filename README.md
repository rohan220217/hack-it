# AI enabled helpdesk system (Sarathi)
This project has been developed using ReactJS and Capacitor. It involves taking input from users, which can be related to a variety of issues such as potholes, blackout zones, waste, and waterlogging. The input is then processed to generate a caption, category, and related hashtags.

The project also includes a comprehensive helpdesk system, designed with a user interface similar to Instagram but with a greater focus on practicality and usefulness. Overall, the project provides an efficient and streamlined way for users to report issues and receive assistance in a timely manner.
